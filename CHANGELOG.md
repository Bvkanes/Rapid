# [2.0.0-beta]

#### 2022-Dec-15
### Bugfixes:
* [#685] fixed the color for mapillary image pins.

[#685]: https://github.com/facebook/RapiD/issues/685
# [2.0.0-alpha3]

#### 2022-Nov-21

#### :tada: New Features, Updates, and Improvements
We have some new area labelling to show off! Areas now get an icon/label associated with them drawn at the 'pole of inaccessibility'.

We have completely rewritten the code that associates an OSM shape with its constituent renderable pixi shapes- allowing us to detect hovers over an area's border, fill, etc. This improves snapping, hovering, and map interactions in general.

All drawing modes are now available and should work well (We do expect some bugs at this point still).

Wireframe mode (w) is back [#497], as well as the feature filtering [#584] for OSM features!

We've substantially reduced the bundle size by rebuilding some dependent projects with pixi v7 [#492], [#632]
* [#617] Code is now based off Pixi.v7.
* [#502] The walkthrough has been restored!
* [#499] All draw modes should now be working & available. Hooray!
* [#531] Lasso drawing to select OSM Nodes is back!
* [#538] Way midpoints now render and are interactive (double click, click-to-drag)
* [#652] double-clicking on a way (or at a midpoint) should now add a node to the way.


### Bugfixes:
* [#493] We've set webGL2 as the preferred method of starting up and haven't seen this issue since.
* [#495] Not a bug, actually- this was just an 'area-fill' issue before we had partials.
* [#518] Double-clicking to finish a way no longer zooms the map.
* [#519] Area drawing mode should work once again.
* [#521] The 'Notes' layer, hotkeys, and editing should work once again.
* [#524] Fixed a bug with way moving causing exceptions in rare cases.
* [#529] Right-clicking an empty part of the map should correctly show the 'paste' option.
* [#554] Continuing a line should work once again ('a' hotkey)
* [#555] No more auto-zoom after drawing a feature.
* [#556], [#569] Fixed a bug that caused keyboard/mouse events to get eaten after exiting a drawing mode.
* [#558] Fixed a bug with history / state annotations causing too many undo states during line drawing.
* [#561], [#660] Lines should now be closeable when drawing.
* [#562] Copy and Paste should now work correctly.
* [#563] Adding nodes to existing lines should work again in all browsers.
* [#565] Verified that Black-screen problems during data validation no longer occur.
* [#566] users should now be able to add nodes to the lines and area features.
* [#571] Fix a bug that was preventing ESRI buildings from conflating properly.
* [#572] Snapping to ways that are already on the map should be back to normal.
* [#580], [#581], and [#582] Added new templates for bug submissions!
* [#586] Area add button is now available, the mode is implemented!
* [#608] The preset picker dialog in the sidebar now correctly opens when the user adds a new untagged feature to the map.
* [#609] Various history fixes have been made to the line and area drawing modes, undo/redo should do the correct things to the change stack now.
* [#620] Fixed the 'destroy' calls for pixi v7 and bitmap text labels, freeing up more memory.
* [#627] Loading notes no longer causes a stack trace
* [#629] Fixed resource loading of textures during tests, also sped up resource loads of spritesheets by making the load promises parallel.
* [#630] Fixed many, many unit tests to go along with all these fixes/changes.
* [#637] Adding notes should now work.
* [#639] Fix the 'a' hotkey for adding to a line.
* [#646] FIxed a bug where clicking to snap to an area while hovering the fill caused a stack trace.
* [#648] Fixed a hover/snapping bug that prevented features from attaching to other features mid-draw.
* [#654] Fixed a bug with right-clicking on multiselections
* [#661] Cursors should properly update when transitioning in & out of modes.
* [#670] Double-clicking on a pre-existing node during way-drawing should leave the history in the correct state (with no 'extra' states to undo)

##### 2019-Nov-25

#### :tada: New Features
This release includes the buildings layer from Microsoft as an enabled feature layer! Read more about it here:
https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2019-09/microsoft-releases-18M-building-footprints-in-uganda-and-tanzania-to-enable-ai-assisted-mapping

For up-to-date availability of roads and buildings, check our continually-updated GeoJSON link here: https://github.com/facebookmicrosites/Open-Mapping-At-Facebook/blob/develop/data/rapid_releases.geojson

#### :sparkles: Usability
* The RapiD button is no longer an AI-roads toggle- instead, a dialog opens allowing you to enable Facebook's road layer, Microsoft's building layer, or nothing at all.
